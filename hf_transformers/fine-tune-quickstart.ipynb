I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

Couldn't be much better, especially with a menu that contained other Greek and Mediterranean specialties such as leg of lamb.  While the servings were ample, the desserts, rice pudding and cheesecake are something to save room for.  The server was a very nice older lady, just like mom.

My husband ordered the fish and chips and tried a few bites of it as well, it was great with wonderful flaky crust. Their tartar sauce was amazing.
